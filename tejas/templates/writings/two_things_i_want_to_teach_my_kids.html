		Growth mindset and Benevolence.</p>

		<p>When I grew like many of fellow brown peers I was told I was so smart at Math and Science. The key word being "smart". This is was mostly a fair statement during high school as the bar wasn't set high. However, things changed as I hit University and soon I wasn't the "smartest" person on the block. It took many hard learnt lessons to get me to start seeing the difference between the Fixed and Growth mindset. By telling me I am "smart" people built into to me a sense of entitlement of just being good at things. That I wouldn't need to work hard to attain anything. As a result I ended up, for a long time, avoiding the hardest things and really trying see what was the ceiling for me. I am now sure I don't wish to repeat the same mistake with my children. From day one I want them to understand that there is no such thing as being "smart", rather just degrees of hard work. So when my kid comes home with an A+ on a math test, instead of saying "Wow! You must be good at Math", I will say "Wow! You must have really worked hard on this".</p>

		<p>For much of my life I have been quite self-centered. It really hit me yesterday when I visited my high school teacher. As I sat there asking her how things were going, I realized I didn't actually know much about her as a person and her life. I had sickening feeling and I knew I had to remedy that. For the first time I started asking her about her career path, her personal life and how she is doing as a person. I felt a huge sense of relief with every answer.  I felt closer to a her, a person I considered a mentor, much more than I had ever before. Reflecting back on that experience I knew I would have had a much more transformative effect than the intellectual relationship I had. I would truly want my kids to be able to connect with people at a deeper level that I feel I am starting now much earlier in their life. Instead of telling my kids to avoid talking to strangers, I will encourage them to get to know everyone. I want them to connect with people by caring for them more I did with my friends and mentors.</p>
