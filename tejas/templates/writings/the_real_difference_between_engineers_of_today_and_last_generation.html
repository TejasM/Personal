		Yesterday, I sent most of my day working with my father on renovating the bathroom. My father is a mechanical and industrial engineer, while I am a computer engineer. As we worked I thought about the difference between my craft and his. Over the years my craft has evolved into one where I dive into problems and learn through trial and error. However in case of my father, I noticed that he took a more cautious and calculated approach. His approach was to apply the best problem solving framework he had after looking at the problem from multiple angles. At one point I was observing my father using a highly flammable propane tank to solder pipes together. This made me realize that my approach in situations like this would not only be ineffective but also hazardous. Extrapolation from this thought made me realize that, regardless of the field of Engineering, the cost of failure in previous generations was much higher. Even in a low failure cost field like software the cost in past generations was much higher due to more expensive hardware, more development time, and longer feedback loops. As the cost of failure has lower in past few generations, so has the mindset of the problem solvers of today.</p>

		<p>In the past engineers required rigorous training in specific skills so that they could go out and apply those skills with perfection. However, with lower cost of failure and tighter feedback loops we are in a world where we can afford to have less highly skilled professionals and more receptive learners. As such our model of education also has to change, it should now be less about imparting skills and more about helping students become life long learners by hacking the lower cost of failure and tighter feedback loops in today's society.
