		Recently I have been struggling with conflicting advice on whether to "follow your passion", as touted by Steve Jobs, or focus on ability as people like Derek Sivers and Cal Newport suggest. I don't really know which is the right path, but I also know I shouldn't try to do both. I really need to pick one and soon. I remember last year I had reached out to Larry Smith, by happenstance, while selling in Waterloo University. At the same time I was reading Cal Newport's "So Good They Can't Ignore You". Professor  Smith and Cal Newport's viewpoints were complete opposites and I knew I had to dig further when I got the chance to meet with Professor Smith. During this same time my startup was growing and we were hitting a lot of goals we had set and passion was high. So I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to put this question to rest.</p>

		<p>My meeting with him was in many ways a version of his TED Talk except I could rebut and pose questions. I knew referencing Cal Newport's work would really get Professor Smith going, so I pulled on that thread. What I got out was a strong argument against the idea of working towards something without passion for it. The argument at the core is simple: how do you expect to work at something when you don't have passion for it. I followed and understood the argument because I knew from my experience things that truly cared about I would always do better at. Professor Smith also pointed out most people in typical jobs end up being satisfied with it because it offers "security". As I mentioned my startup at the time was growing quite well and I was extremely passionate about the problem I was solving and the challenges that came with them. I left the room with a sense that the passion would drive me forward.</p>

		<p>Fast forward a year, I still have a drive for the problem but the passion for it no longer burns as strongly. Worse the startup didnâ€™t hit the growth curve and I started to lose momentum. Since then I have grown more acclimatized to the saying that saying, "Passion is fleeting but hard work and discipline are permanent". I have realized more than passion, creative sparks, or motivation, it will be my ability to get to my desk at 9am and put deliberate and dedicated hours into my craft that will determine whether I achieve my goals or not.</p>

		<p>I am now believe the way to move forward is to decide on a rare skill that you want to focus on and align every move to maximize that skill. For me that skill is Product Management. I know that I have the technical skills to be a top 5% coder, but even the top 5% in that space is a massive number of people. I am in a similar boat in data science. One option is to niche further and focus on an aspect of coding or data science that is needed but is a smaller subset of the competition. However, I feel that makes me too specialized and too dependent on the future of certain technologies. As such I have already started my path in product management with my startup. It is a broad and a universal skill that can transition from any field that is only just starting to receive significant traction.
